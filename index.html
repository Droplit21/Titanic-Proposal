<h2>feature List</h2>
<p>I want there to be interactable links on the screen that take you to other pages that relate to the swim team. I want there to be animated backgrounds and I want everything to be very colorful. I want to have all of our pictures up at the top of the page aswell.</p>

<p>I plan to include our emails. I will be adding pictures of all of us. I want the background to be colored and also some text.</p>
